<h3>Task 1 </h3>
Project name: HW10_Mixed.
<br>
Write one program that implements the following methods and calls in <tt>main</tt>:


<ol>		
	<li> A method called <tt>indexOf1D</tt> that takes as arguments 2 arrays of integers called bigArray and smallArray, that implements for arrays of integers what indexOf does for strings. It checks if smallArray is a subarray of bigArray. If it is not, it returns -1. If it is a subarray, the method returns the index of bigArray where smallArray starts.  For example: 
	<br>indexOf1D({3,1,5,7,2,3,1}, {5,7,2,3}) returns 2 , but  
	<br>indexOf1D({3,1,5,7,2,3,1}, {5,7,3})   returns -1 because the sequence 5,7,3 is not in {3,1,5,7,2,3,1}.
	</li><li> A method called <tt>indexOf2D</tt> that takes as arguments 2 2D <b>arrays</b> of integers called bigArray and smallArray, that implements for 2D arrays what <tt>indexOf1D</tt> does for 1D arrays of integers. It checks if smallArray is a "patch" of bigArray. If it is not, it returns -1. If it is a subarray, the method returns the row and column indexes of bigArray where smallArray starts. For example: 
	<pre> 
	if bigArray is:
	3,1,5,7,2,3,1
	4,1,7,2,8,5,0
	1,2,3,9,0,2,1
	</pre>
	and smallArrays is:
	<pre>	5,7,2,3
	7,2,8,5
	</pre>
	The method will return indexes 0 and 2. You cannot return 2 numbers as 2 separate entities. You must return them as an array of int or an ArrayList.
	<br>If the small array is not a 'patch' of the bigArray, return -1 and -1.
	<br><font color="RED"> Hint: use a helper method that checks that an array overlaps at row, r, and column c. </font>  
	</li><li> A method called <tt>convert10ToB(int N, int B)</tt> that takes as arguments a number, N, (assumed in base 10) and another number B that expresses the base. You can assume that B is at most 16. The method can have any return type that you want (int, String, array, ArrayList). If called with B&gt;16 the method will print an error message.
	Example 1:
	<pre>	Enter N: 109
	Enter B: 2
	109 in base 2 is: 1101101
	</pre>
	Additional example 2:
	<pre>	Enter N: 618
	Enter B: 5
	618 in base 5 is: 4433
	</pre>
	Additional example 3:
	<pre>	Enter N: 7132
	Enter B: 16
	7132 in base 16 is: 1BDC
	</pre>

	</li><li> A method called <tt>reverseLines</tt> that takes as argument a filename, <i>fnm</i> (e.g. "data1"), and creates another file, <i>fnm_out.txt</i> (e.g. "data1_out.txt"), reverses each line from data1.txt and prints the lines in reverse order in data1_out.txt. For example if a file data1.txt contains text:
	<pre>	cats, dogs, mice
	tulip
	head, nose
	5 6 1 2
	</pre>
	after the method is called for "data1.txt" a new file called "data1_out.txt" will be created and it will have text:
	<pre>	2 1 6 5	
	eson ,daeh
	pilut
	ecim ,sgod ,stac
	</pre>
</li></ol>

<font color="red"><b>In order to call these methods from main, you can hardcode the arrays (in main, NOT IN THE METHODS), but allow the user to enter the file name with the data.</b> </font>

<br> The file data1.txt is <a href="http://vlm1.uta.edu/~alex/courses/1310/homework/hw10/data1.txt">here</a>.

<h3>Suggestions</h3>

Pay close attention to all specifications on this page, including 
file names and submission format. Even in cases where the program works correctly, 
points will be taken off for non-compliance with the instructions given on this 
page (such as wrong file names, wrong compression format for the submitted code, 
and so on). The reason is that non-compliance with the instructions makes the 
grading process significantly (and unnecessarily) more time consuming. Contact the 
instructor or TA if you have any questions. 

<h3>How to submit</h3>

<p>
**** The assignment should be submitted via <a href="http://elearn.uta.edu">Blackboard</a>. 
</br>
<font color = "red">Put the HW10_Mixed.java file and the input data file, data1.txt, in a folder called hw10, zip the folder and submit hw10.zip.  You do not need to submit the output files. Those will be created by your program as we run it.</font>
<hr>
<h3>Penalties</h3>
All files must be placed in a  folder named hw10 . Zip that folder and email the zipped file.
</br> Up to <b>7 points</b> will be lost for non-compliance with the submission requirements: folder name, all files in a folder, zipped folder, the compressed file is a zip, the program files have extension .java, program, your name and the program description at the top,...


<ol>
	
<font color = red>
<li>CODE THAT DOES NOT RUN  due to a SYNTAX ERROR 25%-70% penalty per task.  Note that the maximum penalty is 70%.</li>
</font>

<li> RUN-TIME ERROR FOR INPUT SPECIFICALLY SHOWED AS AN EXAMPLE: 20% of task grade. Runtime-error for graderâ€™s input: 5-20% of task grade (depending on the reason of why it fails).  </br>
</li>

<li> A program that has no comments and/or meaning variable names receives a penalty of 10% of the points per task. </li>

<li> **** Code using elements we had not covered at the time the homework was due receives no credit. 
</ol>
