 <h3>Task 1 (15 pts) </h3>
<p>
Project: HW5_MathOperations
 <br>
Write a program that performs the following operations: +, -, *, /, % (as defined by Java). Your program should first read the first number, then the operation, and then the second number. Both numbers are integers. If, for the operation, the user entered one of the symbols shown above, your program should perform the corresponding operation and compute the result.  After that it should print the operation and the result. If the operation is not recognized, the program should display a message about it. You do not need to do any input validation for the integers.
<br>
Hints: 
</p><ol>
	<li> The operation should be read in as a string. 
	</li><li> If your program is not reading the operation or the second number properly, and you are using nextLine(), check the page titled "Why nextLine() seems to not work sometimes" from the  "Input and Formatted Output" slides.
</li></ol>
<br><br>
Here are a few sample runs:
<pre>---- Sample run 1:
Enter the first number: 6
Enter the operation: +
Enter the second number: 10
6 + 10  =  16

---- Sample run 2:
Enter the first number: 7
Enter the operation: /
Enter the second number: 4
7 / 4  =  1

---- Sample run 3:
Enter the first number: 7
Enter the operation: %
Enter the second number: 4
7 % 4  =  3

---- Sample run 4:
Enter the first number: 9
Enter the operation: #
Enter the second number: 8
This operation is not recognized.
</pre>

Here are two examples of behavior when the operation is not recognized. Either one of them is fine. <br>
first:
<pre>---- Sample run:
Enter the first number: 9
Enter the operation: jj
Enter the second number: 8
This operation is not recognized.
</pre>

second:
<pre>---- Sample run:
Enter the first number: 9
Enter the operation: jj
Enter the second number: 8
This operation is not recognized.
<font color="RED">9 jj 8  =  0    </font>
</pre>

<h3>Task 2 (30 pts) </h3>
<p>
Project: HW5_DivisorsA2B
 <br>
Write a program that prints the divisors for each number in the range [A,B] (given by the user). 
</p><ol>
	<li>You can assume that B&lt;=9999. 	
	</li><li>Match the output exactly. Reserve the same number of spaces as shown for the leftmost number on each row. 
	</li><li>The program will print a line of dashes as separator between the rows. The length of this line is also given by the user.
	</li><li>Print the line of dashes before, between, and at the end of each row as shown in the sample run. 
</li></ol>	
<pre>--------  Sample run normal 1

--------  Sample run special case 1
This program will print the divisors of each number in the [A,B].
Enter A:7
Enter B:5
Enter length of horizontal line:50

Bye


--------  Sample run special case 2 
This program will print the divisors of each number in the [A,B].
Enter A:9999
Enter B:9999
Enter length of horizontal line:50

--------------------------------------------------
9999 : 3, 9, 11, 33, 99, 101, 303, 909, 1111, 3333, 9999,

 <h3>Task 3 (25 pts) </h3>
Project: HW5_Pattern2
 <br>
 Write a program that asks the user for 2 numbers, <tt>len</tt> and <tt>repeat</tt>, and prints a pattern of size <tt>len</tt> X <tt>len</tt> as shown. The pattern:
 <ol>
	<li> the first line starts with \ and follows with - until the next dash. You can think of this as the 'main' pattern
	</li><li> the next line has the same pattern but it starts from the first - after the \
	</li><li> the 2-nd line starts at the 2-nd - after the \.
	</li><li> and so on.
	</li><li> (You can think that on each line you have the pattern from the line above but but off by one position.)
 </li></ol>
  See the first quiz on loops and nested loops for examples of code that produce similar (but easier) patterns.
