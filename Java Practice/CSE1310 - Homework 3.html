<h1>Homework 3</h1>

Total points: 100 <br> <br>
Topics: complex boolean expressions, while loops.  



  <br>
 
 <hr>
 
 
 <h3>Task 1 (25pts) </h3>
Create project: HW3_Abs
<br> Submit java file: HW3_Abs.java
<br><br>
 
Write a program that takes two real numbers <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>. Your program will need to compute <i>|a-b|</i>  (in this order).  
You CANNOT use the Math.abs function for this. Instead you must compute the difference and turn it into a positive value. Or you can compare the numbers and use that to decide if you want to use a-b or b-a.
<br>
Print the larger number minus the smaller number and the result as shown below.
<br>
You can use a method or not use a method (write the code directly in the "main" method).
<br>
(5 points) On a separate document called answers.pdf draw the flowchart for this program. (If you wrote your code in a new method, draw the flow chart for that method.)

<pre>------ Sample run 1:
Enter a: 2
Enter b: 7
7.00-2.00 = 5.00

------ Sample run 2:
Enter a: 7
Enter b: 2
7.00-2.00 = 5.00

------ Sample run 3:
Enter a: 16.5321
Enter b: 90
90.00-16.53 = 73.47
</pre>

 <h3>Task 2 (20 pts)   - complex boolean expression</h3>
Create project: HW3_Aries  
<br> Submit java file: HW3_Aries.java
<br><br>
 
Write a program that reads the month and the day from the user and prints whether or not someone born on that date is under the Aries astrological sign or not.<br>
Anyone born between and including March 21 and April 19 is Aries.
<br> You can assume that the month and day are given as integer numbers (e.g. do not worry about user enterring March)
<br>
Hint: write the condition for an Aries date in March. Write the condition for April. Put these two together.
<pre>--- Sample run:
Enter the month: 3
Enter the day: 21
Aries.

--- Sample run:
Enter the month: 4
Enter the day: 19
Aries.

--- Sample run:
Enter the month: 3
Enter the day: 27
Aries.

--- Sample run:
Enter the month: 4
Enter the day: 6
Aries.

--- Sample run:
Enter the month: 3
Enter the day: 40
Not Aries.

--- Sample run:
Enter the month: 4
Enter the day: -5
Not Aries.

--- Sample run:
Enter the month: 2
Enter the day: 27
Not Aries.
</pre>
Extra (for practice, not grade): recognize the month in other formats as well: Mar, March, 3, 03, Apr, April, 4, 04. 

<hr>
 <h3>Task 3 (20 pts) - easy loop</h3>
Project name: HW3_Faces
<br>
Write a program that repeatedely prints the face from homework 1, until the user chooses to stop. See sample run for the expected behavior.
<pre>--- Sample run 1:
Do you want me to draw a face (yes/no)? no


--- Sample run 2:
Do you want me to draw a face (yes/no)? yes
    -------
   /       \
   | o   o |
   |   ^   |
    \  -  /
     -----
Do you want me to draw a face (yes/no)? Yes
    -------
   /       \
   | o   o |
   |   ^   |
    \  -  /
     -----
Do you want me to draw a face (yes/no)? YES
    -------
   /       \
   | o   o |
   |   ^   |
    \  -  /
     -----
Do you want me to draw a face (yes/no)? yessss
</pre>
Extra (for practice, NOT for grade): You can improve the program to ask if the user had a good or a bad day and it prints a happy or sad face.


 <hr>
 <h3>Task 4 (30 pts) - complex program, 2-3 step processing, non-trivial data manipulation, formatted printing</h3>
Project name: HW3_Bank
 <br>
 Write a program that simulates bank transactions for an account. When the program starts, the user is prompted to enter the amount of money in their account.
<br>
 Next the user is repeatedly prompted for transactions. He/she enters a real number for each transaction:
 <ol> 
	<li> positive numbers mean money added to the bank. 
	</li><li> negative numbers mean money removed from the bank. 
	</li><li> 0 means the user has no more transactions. The loop will stop.
</li></ol>
Finally the program should display a message that compares the current ballance with the original one (before the transactions).
<br> See sample runs below.
<br> Match the output, especially teh formated printing of the transaction and ballance.
<pre>--- Sample run 1:
This program simulates transactions in a bank account.
Enter your current ballance (money in your account): 1076.1234
Enter transaction: 15
|transaction|   ballance|
|      15.00|    1091.12|
Enter transaction: -20
|transaction|   ballance|
|     -20.00|    1071.12|
Enter transaction: 100
|transaction|   ballance|
|     100.00|    1171.12|
Enter transaction: 80
|transaction|   ballance|
|      80.00|    1251.12|
Enter transaction: -2000
|transaction|   ballance|
|   -2000.00|    -748.88|
Enter transaction: 50
|transaction|   ballance|
|      50.00|    -698.88|
Enter transaction: 0
You lost money.
Bye

--- Sample run 2:
This program simulates transactions in a bank account.
Enter your current ballance (money in your account): 89.56789
Enter transaction: 10
|transaction|   ballance|
|      10.00|      99.57|
Enter transaction: -5
|transaction|   ballance|
|      -5.00|      94.57|
Enter transaction: 20
|transaction|   ballance|
|      20.00|     114.57|
Enter transaction: 60
|transaction|   ballance|
|      60.00|     174.57|
Enter transaction: 0
You made money or have the same as when you started.
Bye

--- Sample run 3:
This program simulates transactions in a bank account.
Enter your current ballance (money in your account): 0
Enter transaction: 15.789
|transaction|   ballance|
|      15.79|      15.79|
Enter transaction: -15.789
|transaction|   ballance|
|     -15.79|       0.00|
Enter transaction: 0
You made money or have the same as when you started.
Bye


--- Sample run 4:
This program simulates transactions in a bank account.
Enter your current ballance (money in your account): -100
Enter transaction: 0
You made money or have the same as when you started.
Bye
</pre>
Extra (for practice, not grade): in the line, also print teh ballance before the transaction. E.g:
<pre>Enter transaction: -5
|   ballance|transaction|   ballance|
|      99.57|      10.00|      94.57|

</pre>
